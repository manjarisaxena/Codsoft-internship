# 🚀 Codsoft-Internship

This repository contains projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. The projects involve machine learning and data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Projects

### 🌸 1. Iris Flower Classification
- 🌿 A machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on petal and sepal measurements.
- 📊 Uses popular classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- 📚 Dataset: Iris dataset from sklearn.

### 🎬 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
- ⭐ A predictive model to estimate movie ratings based on different features such as genre, budget, and audience reviews.
- 🧠 Uses regression techniques for prediction.

### 🚢 3. Titanic Survival Prediction
- 🏆 A classification model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on factors like age, gender, class, and fare.
- 📈 Implemented using logistic regression, support vector machines, or decision trees.
- 📂 Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
